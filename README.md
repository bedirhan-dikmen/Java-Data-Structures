# Java - Singly Linked List to Doubly Linked List Conversion

This project demonstrates how to convert a **singly linked list** into a **doubly linked list** in Java.  
It also provides methods to print the list in both **forward** and **reverse** directions.

## Features
- Add elements to a **singly linked list**.
- Convert the **singly linked list** into a **doubly linked list**.
- Print the list in **normal order**.
- Print the list in **reverse order** after conversion.

## How It Works
1. The `ekle(int veri)` method adds new nodes to the singly linked list.
2. The `ciftYonList()` method converts the list into a doubly linked list.
3. The `yazdir()` method prints the list in the forward direction.
4. The `tersYazdir()` method prints the list in reverse.

## Usage
Compile and run the program in any Java environment:
