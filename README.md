# Java - Singly Linked List to Doubly Linked List Conversion

This project demonstrates how to convert a **singly linked list** into a **doubly linked list** in Java.  
It also provides methods to print the list in both **forward** and **reverse** directions.

## ðŸ“Œ Features
- Add elements to a **singly linked list**.
- Convert the **singly linked list** into a **doubly linked list**.
- Print the list in **normal order**.
- Print the list in **reverse order** after conversion.

## ðŸš€ How It Works?
1. The `ekle(int veri)` method adds new nodes to the singly linked list.
2. The `ciftYonList()` method converts the list into a doubly linked list.
3. The `yazdir()` method prints the list in the forward direction.
4. The `tersYazdir()` method prints the list in reverse.


# Palindrome Checker (Java)

This project is a Java program that checks whether a given word is a **palindrome** or not.  
A palindrome is a word that **reads the same forward and backward** (e.g., "radar", "kayak", "level").

## ðŸ“Œ Features
- Takes **user input** for a word.
- **Reverses the word** using a stack.
- **Compares the original and reversed word** to determine if it is a palindrome.
- Displays the result on the screen.

## ðŸ›  Data Structure Used
- A **Stack (LIFO - Last In, First Out)** is used to reverse the word.
- **StringBuilder** is used to construct the reversed word.

## ðŸš€ How It Works?
1. The program asks the user to **enter a word**.
2. The word is **pushed into a Stack** character by character.
3. The **word is reversed using Stack operations**.
4. The original word is **compared with the reversed word**.
5. If they match, the word is **a palindrome**; otherwise, it is **not a palindrome**.

## Usage
Compile and run the program in any Java environment:
